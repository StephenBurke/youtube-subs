## Conclusions

We can clearly see that by far the most watch content on YouTube is Shows follwed by Trailers, Music, Education, and Sports. All very popular catergories for many a people to find interesting or worth while. I like the bit about the Trailers data; how it's the second most watched content on the sight yet people seem to believe when it comes to trailers once is enough.

As for the graph on the right, it's clear to see the the most commonly rewatched category is Music. The same videos are being watched over and over again. Now on the other end of the spectrum Nonprofits & Activism, and News & Politics are the two least rewatched categories on YouTube. This follows because much of that material is very much of an "in the moment" experience. Trailers and Sports are also near the bottom of rewatched content. When was the last time you watched the trailer for Toy Story? Following the mode that is Music we see Education, People & Blogs, Film & Animation, and Comedy take up the next grouping, if you will, of rewatched content. So people like to learn and learn about others.
